# my-first-project
This is my first project on GitHub.

I have made a simple stop watch using tkinter in python. It contains 3 buttons, start to start the timer, stop to pause the timer and reset to reset the timer to 0.

This is my 1st code in python to learn about class and GUI based libraries, and will upload more in future.
